              As part of an audiovisual course, I directed and edited a video. I
              chose the music Tomorrow by Jorja Smith because it is a music that
              particularly touches me. It tells the story of a person who must
              leave in order to heal despite the love that can be brought to him
              where he is. That's what I tried to convey through the image.

          After seeing the movie "Portrait of a Girl on Fire" and analyzing the
          official poster of the movie, I tried to create one that corresponds
          to the movie in my opinion. On top I represented page 28, it has a
          great importance since it is on this page that Marianne draws herself
          and seals her love with Heloise. I also represented Marianne and
          Heloise themselves in the form of a drawing because it is their love
          that is the subject of the whole film.

            Before we started our Art and Science project, we did campaigns
            against binge drinking. We had a time constraint: we had to make 8
            Instagram posts in 24 hours. We decided to make like a "vlog" of a
            party where we see the evolution of the state of a person during a
            party until the end so that the viewer can put himself in the place
            of the person and see the dangers.
