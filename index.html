        During my training, I learned to understand the user, his needs and the
        needs of an environment in general. So I learned how to make interview
        guides and analyze them. I also worked on the ergonomics of websites. We
        have seen to put ourselves in the place of a disabled user or having
        certain difficulties in order to develop more ergonomic sites.

        I learned during my training to answer to problems in a clear and
        concise way. In particular, I worked on the development of a
        communication strategy and graphic charter, seeking to best meet the
        expectations of users. <br />
        I also seek to develop my English and my Spanish in order to make my
        work accessible to as many people as possible.

        When I do a job, I like to try to express a message. I am particularly
        touched by the causes of feminism, LGBT or racism. Thanks to the
        training, I was able to learn how to express my messages through
        audiovisual, graphics or even communication alone. <br />
        I have carried out many projects for the fight of these causes.

        I have deepened my skills in terms of development. I realized many
        websites for my training but also for my personal projects. <br />
        I also touched CMS like Wordpress on which I realized a newspaper.
        <br />
        I also learned how to host sites on several hostings. <br />
