          In the second half of the year, we conducted interviews to find out
          what our target audience wants from our science outreach. <br />
          Thanks to this, we were able to see what they liked, and adapt what we
          intended to do. I suggest you look at our analysis if you want to see
          what we learned from our interviews.

        <p class="second-competence-text">
          In order to understand the challenges of website accessibility, I
          conducted several studies. First, I analyzed the PrimeVideo website. I
          noted what I thought were the problems, and then I made a
          questionnaire to see what the users think about it. Thanks to this, I
          was able to do a complete analysis of the site. <br />
          Secondly, I studied the accessibility of the "SortiràParis" website by
          taking into account what I observed on the previous website but also
          by using an extension simulating disabilities.
