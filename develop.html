              I realized the newspaper of the Bat'H. To realize it I tried to
              follow the graphic charter previously established in spite of the
              constraints of WordPress. This site will be updated regularly in
              order to keep up to date with what's going on at our IUT. Many
              students are motivated to help us to realize articles.

          To explain the steps of beer making, we made animations. I made
          several elements in vector on Illustrator. I also participated in the
          creation of the first animation. On this subject, I did not acquire
          all the skills that I hope to develop in the future. My classmate
          helped me a lot by explaining me the steps. On the other hand, I fully
          integrated the animations in the website and I also realized all the
          paths in the animations to link them together.

            I entirely designed and developed the ISIS website. The site was
            realized in order to popularize the beer. We can thus find 2 pages,
            realized with students of the Biological Engineering course, a page
            with animations where we detail the stages of the manufacture of
            beer and a page where we show the climatic impact of beer. Thanks to
            its design, I also tried to show the impact that women had on the
            making of beer. We can also find a shop.

          In order to be of service but especially to improve my skills in HTML
          and CSS, I offered to develop the portfolio of a friend. <br /><br />
          As soon as the design was sent to me, I developed the portfolio in one
          week in parallel to my classes.

            As for the other portfolio, I also developed this site for a student

            The design was also made by the student, I, after receiving the
            models, realized this site in three days.
